# PS2toDB9Adapter
Use your Playstation2 Dualshock with Retro Computers (Commodore, Amiga and Atari)

For this project I used Bill Porter's PS2X Arduino Library (http://www.billporter.info/2010/06/05/playstation-2-controller-arduino-library-v1-0/)

For detailed information, please visit (http://seco.gen.tr/2020/07/20/ps2-dualshock-to-c64-joystick-port-mod/)

Use mouse_and_joystick arduino source code to add mouse functionality to your adapter.
To use mouse function (For Amiga only) Press R2 or L2 on Dualshock and move right analog stick. Cross is Left and Square is for Right Mouse Button

For first batch of production (only commodore.gen.tr users), please use v1.1

Other productions use V2 file. (Or you can use the file with mouse support)

# UPDATE:

New double card for C64 will be used to connect to PS2 controllers. Only one Arduino Nano will be enough (Finally tested ok:)

Please download the firmware for double board.
